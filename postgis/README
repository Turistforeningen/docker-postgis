Note that postgresql.conf is *not* included by default in the image. It
represents the current deployment configuration, but will have to be manually
installed in any new deployments.

To edit the configuration, make your changes manually in the current
deployment, and commit the changes here.

To view modified settings, compare this to the current sample configuration:
